                        <p>
                            Welcome! I am Michael, a Technology Architect with 4 years of experience in digital transformation, technology modernisation, and strategic architecture analysis across numerous industries.
                            I specialise in leading architecture and transformation focussed teams, clarifying complex requirements, and delivering impactful insights and solutions that drive successful IT modernisation initiatives.
                            My approach is rooted in fostering collaboration, ensuring alignment, and mitigating risks to achieve meaningful outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in technology, often diving into new programming languages and frameworks.
                            I am also an avid science fiction reader, which inspires my interest in emerging technologies like AI and quantum computingâ€”a passion furthered by my degree in quantum computing theory.
                            Beyond tech, I stay active with a variety of other hobbies such as climbing, taekwondo, and even chess (you can find a chess bot project that usually tests my skills)!
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            On this site, you can find highlights from some of my favourite data analysis and programming projects, along with their links to the GitHub repository.
                            I am passionate about bringing analytics, programming, and other disciplines together to solve complex challenges.
                            I am love collaborating with innovative teams on projects that are revolutionising their respective fields; contributing and learning at the forefront of tech, research, and industries.

                    <p>
                    This Tableau Visualisation is compiled from self scraped and cleansed UK flight data spanning 2019-2021. 
                    The visualisation compares airport and flight activity year on year in this time period. Using the dashboard
                    you are able compare airport performance before and during covid. The dashboard demonstrates common analysis of
                    time series data and packages it into a presentable, interactive Tableau format.

                    <p>Given a history of stock purchases, a portfolio is automatically generated. 
                    By scraping online data, correlation and risk assessment can be determined for 
                    the specific portfolio, while also calculating current and future ROI. Further 
                    visualisations can also be made for the portfolio.</p>
                    
                    <p>Developed a data pipeline using the alpha-vantage API to access minute-by-minute 
                    stock data and package it into a Pandas dataframe. These large datasets are then used 
                    in conjunction with a windowed-data fed LSTM model to predict specific timeframes 
                    into the future.</p>

                    <p>Chess is programmed using the popular pygame library.
                    The game has been programmed such that two players can play each other from the same computer. 
                    There are also two single player game modes, where you can play against a stockfish AI or against a homemade machine learning AI (it isn't as smart as stockfish).</p>
